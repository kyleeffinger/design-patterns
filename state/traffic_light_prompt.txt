Practice Problem: Traffic Light System

Design and implement a state machine for a traffic light system. The traffic light has three states:

Red: Cars must stop.
Green: Cars can go.
Yellow: Cars should prepare to stop.
The transitions between these states are as follows:

From Red to Green after a timer expires.
From Green to Yellow after a timer expires.
From Yellow to Red after a timer expires.

Requirements

State Interface: Define the common interface for all states.
Concrete States: Implement the Red, Green, and Yellow states.
Context: Implement the TrafficLight class that maintains the current state and transitions between states based on a timer.
